  <string name="paragraph2">The painting is a portrait of Lisa Gherardini the wife of Francesco del Giocondo
      and is in oil on a white Lombardy poplarpanel and is believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506.
      Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517. It was acquired by King Francis I of France
      and is now the property of the French Republic on permanent display at the Louvre Museum in Paris since 1797.

\n\nVasaris account of the Mona Lisa comes from his biography of Leonardo published in 1550
      31 years after the artists death. It has long been the best-known source of information on
      the provenance of the work and identity of the sitter. Leonardos assistant Sala√¨ at his death
      in 1525 owned a portrait which in his personal papers was named la Gioconda a painting bequeathed to him by Leonardo.

\n\nThat Leonardo painted such a work and its date were confirmed in 2005 when a scholar at
      Heidelberg University discovered a marginal note in a 1477 printing of a volume written
      by the ancient Roman philosopher Cicero. Dated October 1503 the note was written by Leonardos
      contemporary Agostino Vespucci. This note likens Leonardo to renowned Greek painter
      Apelles who is mentioned in the text and states that Leonardo was at that time working on a painting of Lisa del Giocondo.
